			<h2>Instructions</h2>
		  	<blockquote>
			 	<p>
				  	Please read the attached PDF file carefully and try your best to finish all the required tasks.
				
					When you submit your assignment to Sakai be sure to include a brief description of any academic or professional experience related to web programming.
					
					Insert a status report here for the assignment.  (It is a good idea to type it somewhere else, e.g. in Word.  Then paste the text into this window.
					
					Your grade for your activities today is mainly determined by the quality of this short status report, and particularly how well you follow the instructions (specifications) for the report.  
					Even if the lab is not 100% complete you will still get a good grade if you submit a good status report that accurately describes the status.  E.g., 
					I completed all parts of the assignment successfully; or, I completed most of the assignment, but am still working on x and y; or I only completed part a; etc. 
					
					Also include a comment about something noteworthy or interesting that you learned or encountered.  For example, 
					
					This lab looks easy, but at the beginning I got stuck with value change listener because I didnâ€™t really understand how to achieve the current value of user input 
					(I got this problem because I took firstname to compare with data in array list directly). 
					The correct solution is I should get the current input value of firstname through e.getNewValue().toString and use this value to check with arraylist.   
					It took me about 2.5 hours to complete this lab and another 2 hours to do the readings and review questions.
